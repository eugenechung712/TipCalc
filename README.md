## Notes & shoutouts
For the majority of the project, outside resources were used such as code from: https://guide.freecodecamp.org/tools/calculators/tip-calculator/. In addition, I recieved a ton of assistance from Professor Shane and classmate Neftali. 

The beginning encounter with web frameworks, ember.js, and github was challenging at first. This first project, TipCalculator, was a great way to start learning all three systems and through TipCalculator, I can leverage methods and ideas for future projects.
